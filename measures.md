#Measures 

Measures here are in addition to those already gathered: https://docs.libraries.io/overview#sourcerank

## Distribution

* last release
* av. time between releases
* av. size of release: #commits/size of diff
* #commits since last release/diff size to last release
* #CVEs since last release (direct, dependency tree)
* #unpatched (checks for issues/commits tagged with CVE etc)

## Code

* scale: loc/#methods vs. #committers/contributors
* #dependencies (runtime/build)
* dependency complexity: loc/#methods in dependency tree
* dependency fluidity: %age pinned vs. open dependencies
* has a changelog
* changelog updated with each release
* test coverage %age and trend
* uses CI
* test pass/fail on current C
* #build errors reported
* #rate of build errors reported increase or decrease
* #warnings on CI

## Documentation

* documentation activity (#commits to codebase vs. #commits to documentation files)
* documentaiton coverage
* has a topic on StackExchange
* #questions on StackExchange
* av. time to answer a question on SE
* documentation location

## Community
* has a contributors file
* has a pr and issue template
* activity: rate of activity on project (against rate of ecosystem)
* activity distirbution (issues, labels, comments, prs, commits), since last release
* #publishers
* #committers
* distribution of commits (nth percentile by nth people)
* #contributors (inc. issues created, comments, prs, labels attached)
* distribution of contribution (nth percentile of all activity by nth people)
* rate of issue increase/decrease
* rate of pr increase/decrease
* #active branches vs. dead branches (>1 month without commits)
* av. time to comment on an issue
* av. time to close an issue
* av. time to close a pr
* av. time to fix a CVE
* av. time to roll updates to dependencies into master
* av. time to answer a SE question

## Usage
* %tile of most dependend upon
* rate of dependency (versus rate of new projects added)
* #direct download count
* rate of download count (versus rate of new projects added)
